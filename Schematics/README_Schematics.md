This folder contains examples of explanatory schematics I have created. I list them here in reverse chronological order of creation, along with the original figure legends. 



**RichnessTurnoverSchematic.png:** Schematic showing how habitat and climate can drive community structure through both species mean abundance and turnover. R indicates richness (i.e. number of species in a habitat). When all species respond in the same manner to a given habitat or change in temperature, this changes the mean abundance and thus impacts species richness. Turnover, however, is impacted when different species have higher abundances in different habitats or at different temperatures.



**PhenologicalCorrelationDivergenceSchematic.png:** A)\& B): The mean response of species within a guild may move independently of each other (A) or in tandem with each other (B) depending on how correlated their phenological responses are to a particular driver or suite of drivers. C) \& D): Guilds may have different levels of phenological divergence within a year. C) shows a guild with low phenological divergence, with a lot of overlap between the temporal occurrence of the trait in different species, while D) represents a much more phenologically divergent guild.



**PlantSoilFeedbackSchematic.png:** The possible effects of increasing temperatures on carbon and nitrogen cycling, and plant productivity. Increasing temperatures lead to increased decomposition rates. This can lead to a positive feedback loop (A). It is uncertain whether this positive feedback loop will continue in the long-term, or whether (B) N availability will decrease in the soil as it gets locked up in plant biomass. This would lead to a negative feedback cycle where plant productivity is limited. These processes also affect C cycling. In (A) increasing decomposition activity leads to an increase in soil CO2 loss through respiration, while the increase in plant productivity increases C storage. In (B) the impact on decomposition is uncertain as decomposer activity is positively affected by temperature, but there is less plant litter input to decompose. C storage will decrease due to a reduction in plant productivity. The balance of these two processes will determine whether there is a net increase or decrease in C stored in the system.



**IslandModelSchematic.png:** A visual representation of one step in the individual-based model for a simple version where the mainland community size *J\_M* = 16 and island community size *J\_I* = 9. This shows a step when the mainland has completed its burn-in period and the island has reached zero-sum dynamics following the first migration event. Each circle represents one individual, and the colour and number represent their fitness class *c*. This does not correspond to species identity, which is not shown here. Probabilities of each process occurring when there are multiple options are shown in grey italics. The number of steps that occur per generation differs between the island and the mainland due to their differing community sizes; hence, some mainland steps will occur in isolation, and some will run in tandem with an island step. 



**PlasticityLocalAdaptationSchematic.png:**The different populations involved in a reciprocal transplant experiment and the way in which they can be used to determine the plastic component of phenotypic differences between populations. The green boxes indicate populations in their home environment, and purple boxes are populations that have been transplanted. The phenotypic difference observed between the individuals of the same population in different environments is identified as the difference due to plasticity. This figure appears in Stamp \& Hadfield, 2020 ([https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13565](https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13565))
